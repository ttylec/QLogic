A "typical" non-signalling:

    prob x y a 0 + prob x y a 1 = prob x z a 0 + prob x z a 1

now, let we have observables x, y, z such that on one box:

    quest x 0 + quest x 1 = quest z 0
    quest y 0 + quest y 1 = quest z 0
    quest z 0 + quest z 1 = TrueQuestion

We can think of it as a box with three (not independent) settings: x, y, z.
Each of them can have two outcomes. But then

    prob p x a 0 + prob p x a 1 = prob p y a 0 + prob p y a 1      (*)

from non-signalling, so we have right identification. On the other hand
    
    (*) = prob p z a 0 + prob p z a 1

and this looks interesting, esp. if we could justify:

    prob p z a 0 = prob p x a 0 + prob p x a 1

----------

Once more time, with similar idea. We have two settings: x, y.
First has three outcome, the second has two and moreover:
    
    quest x 0 + quest x 1 = quest y 0 + quest y 1      (*)

Non-signalling in this case is:

    prob p x a 0 + prob p x a 1 + prob p x a 2 = prob p y a 0 + prob p y a 1

If we require that (*) means that:

    prob p x a 0 + prob p x a 1 = prob p y a 0 + prob p y a 1

then prob p x a 2 = 0.


----------

How we would like to "signal":

find state, such that

    prob rho x x 1 1 = 0,     (1a)
    prob rho x x 0 1 = 1      (1b)
    prob rho x y 1 1 = 1,     (2a)
    prob rho x y 0 1 = 0      (2b)

then (by normalization):

    prob rho x x 0 0 = 0,     (1c)
    prob rho x x 1 0 = 0,     (1d)
    prob rho x y 0 0 = 0,     (2c)
    prob rho x y 1 0 = 0.     (2d)

This is impossile, due to non-signalling, because:

    prob rho x x 1 1 + prob rho x x 1 0 = 0, but
    prob rho x y 1 1 + prob rho x y 1 0 = 1

We need (1a,b) (2a,b) but without consequences of normalization...
